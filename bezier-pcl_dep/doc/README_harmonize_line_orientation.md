This function makes sure that all the trajectories (vector of poses) have the same orientation.
It takes a vector acting as an orientation reference. The trajectory is reversed if it's
orientation does not match the one of the reference. The X axis of each pose will also be reversed thus allowing the robot to move along the right direction, see [invertXAxisOfPoses](README_invert_x_axis_of_poses.md).

The following animation shows the result of the harmonzation on a trajectory (the brown line is reversed) :
